# Sentiment-analysis
 Our project revolves around sentiment analysis of text, so for our datasets we relied mostly on sentiment  of language rather than a specific topic or study. This meant we could use a wide range of entries for our  dataset, so we used 2 datasets, one with generic statements with the sentient, and another of movie  reviews.
